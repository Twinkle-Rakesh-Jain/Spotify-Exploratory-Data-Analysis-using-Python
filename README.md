# Spotify-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-Python


## Problem Statement:
The project aimed to analyze patterns in music data from 1922 to 2021 to uncover trends in song popularity, duration, genre characteristics, and relationships between various audio features. The goal was to gain insights into the evolution of music consumption and production over the years.

## Project Execution:
Two datasets from Kaggle were used. The first dataset contained 586,672 entries and 20 columns, including features such as track popularity, duration, danceability, energy, and release dates. The second dataset had 232,726 entries and 18 columns, focusing on genres, popularity, and other audio features. The data was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including visualizations like bar plots, line plots, and correlation heatmaps.
### Key steps included:
1. Identifying trends in song durations over the years, revealing that tracks from the 1920s to the 1960s were generally shorter, likely due to the predominance of vocal-based music during this era. After the 1960s, the average song duration increased, peaking around 2010, followed by a decline in recent years.
2. Analyzing the relationship between different audio features, such as loudness and energy, and their impact on song popularity, using correlation matrices and regression plots.
3. Exploring genre-specific characteristics, identifying that songs in the Classical and World genres had the longest durations, while the 4. Children's music genre had the shortest.
Determining the most popular genres, with Dance, Pop, Rap, Hip Hop, and Reggaeton emerging as the top five.

## Conclusion:
The analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of how music trends have evolved over the decades. It highlighted the shift in song durations, changes in popular genres, and how various audio features correlate with each other. The project demonstrated the power of data analysis in uncovering patterns in large datasets, offering valuable insights into the music industry.
